# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
For this project we were given the task to modify code in order to create a password generator. In working through this task I was able to gain a deeper understanding of "if" and "while" statements, JavaScript prompts, and how to access indices. This project also pushed my critical thinking skills in trying to understand how and why various methods would not work.
